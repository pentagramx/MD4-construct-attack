MD4: Construction And Attack (Python)

The project is a Python step-by-step implementation of the MD4 algorithm in two main parts. The purpose of the project is the in detail understanfing of the mechanics of MD4 as a hash function and how to exploit specific related vulnerabilities.

Part A:
The MD4 hash algorithm construction according to the original paper of Ronald Rivest, "The MD4 Message Digest Algorithm".

Part B:
The attack on the MD4 hash algorithm that follows the book, "Applied Cryptanalysis: Breaking Ciphers in the Real World".

Limitations:
Modules created for use are limited to include basic operations or methods of built-in data types and data structures.
